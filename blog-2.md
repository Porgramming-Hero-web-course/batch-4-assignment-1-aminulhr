# Async/Await: A Cleaner Approach to Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming is crucial in modern web development, particularly for handling non-blocking operations that ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. While callbacks and promises are often used to handle asynchronous tasks, they can lead to convoluted and hard-to-maintain code, especially in more complex flows. Enter **async/await**, a more elegant and readable way to manage asynchronous code.

## Async/Await Explained

Introduced in ES2017, **async/await** simplifies working with promises. With async/await, asynchronous code is written using familiar synchronous structures like `try`, `catch`, and `finally`. This leads to cleaner and more readable code, making it easier to handle complex asynchronous operations.

### Async/Await Example

Hereâ€™s a practical example using the popular **Axios** library to fetch data from an API asynchronously.

```typescript
import axios from "axios";

async function fetchUserAsync(userId: number): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`
    );
    console.log("User fetched successfully:", response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user:", error.message);
  } finally {
    console.log("Fetch operation completed.");
  }
}

fetchUserAsync(1);
```

In the example above, the function `fetchUserAsync()` retrieves data for a specific user. The `await` keyword pauses the function execution until the `axios.get` call resolves, returning the response data. If the operation fails, it is caught by the `catch` block. The `finally` block ensures that a completion message is logged regardless of whether the operation succeeds or fails.

### Comparison to Callbacks

To highlight the clarity of async/await, let's compare it with the callback-based approach:

```typescript
function fetchUserCallback(
  userId: number,
  successCallback: Function,
  errorCallback: Function
): void {
  axios
    .get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`, {
      timeout: 5000,
    })
    .then((response) => {
      console.log("User fetched successfully:", response.data);
      successCallback();
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error fetching user:", error.message);
      errorCallback();
    });
}

fetchUserCallback(
  1,
  () => {
    console.log("Callback - Fetch operation completed.");
  },
  () => {
    console.log("Callback - An error occurred during fetch.");
  }
);
```

In the callback implementation, the code becomes less readable due to nested `.then()` and `.catch()` methods. As the complexity increases, it becomes harder to follow the flow of the asynchronous operations, leading to what is commonly known as "callback hell."
